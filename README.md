# Create a tool environment containing mamba
conda create -n conda-tools -c conda-forge mamba -y

```

### 2. Project Initialization
Run the setup script to prepare the directory structure and fetch binary files via Git LFS.
* **Windows (CMD/PowerShell):** `bash setup.sh`
* **Linux/macOS/Git Bash:** `./setup.sh`
